# Design Systems in Practice: How UX Engineers Drive Consistency

*Feburary 2024*

Design systems are more than shared Figma files—they’re **living products** that empower teams to build faster, better, and more consistently. As UX engineers, we operationalize these systems into code.

Our job is to turn abstract design tokens into **flexible, reusable components**. That means creating scalable APIs, writing clean documentation, and ensuring accessibility is built into every layer.

A button isn’t just a button—it’s a **system entry point**. It must support variants, states, sizes, and contexts. Build for **customization**, but enforce **boundaries**. Too much flexibility leads to design drift.

Design systems free teams from reinventing the wheel—so they can focus on solving real user problems.
