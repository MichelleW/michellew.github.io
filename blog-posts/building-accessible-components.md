# Building Accessible Components

*November 2024*

A deep dive into creating inclusive web experiences through properly implemented accessibility features and best practices.

## Building Accessible Components: A UX Engineerâ€™s Responsibility

### 1. Semantic HTML
- Using proper heading hierarchy
- Implementing ARIA labels when needed
- Structuring content meaningfully

### 2. Keyboard Navigation
- Focus management
- Skip links
- Visible focus indicators
- Proper tab order

### 3. Screen Reader Support
- Alt text for images
- ARIA roles and properties
- Live regions for dynamic content
- Descriptive link text

## Testing Strategies

- Manual testing with screen readers
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast verification

## Common Patterns
```jsx
 
// Example of an accessible button component
const AccessibleButton = ({ onClick, children }) => (
  <button
    onClick={onClick}
    aria-label="Custom action button"
    className="custom-button"
  >
    {children}
  </button>
);

```

Accessibility is not just about screen readers - it's about creating an inclusive experience for all users.
