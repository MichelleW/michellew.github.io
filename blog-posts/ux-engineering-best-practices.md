# UX Engineering Best Practices: Bridging Design and Code

*September 2024*

As a UX Engineer, bridging the gap between design and development is crucial for creating seamless user experiences. Here are some key practices that help maintain this balance.

UX engineering sits at the intersection of product design and frontend development. Our role is to make user-centered designs not only functional, but delightful and scalable. To do this well, **consistency**, **empathy**, and **systems thinking** are essential.

Start by building strong communication loops with designersâ€”understand the *why* behind their decisions. Align on component behaviors, not just visuals. Use tools like **Storybook** to prototype and validate interactions early. In code, prioritize **readability** and **maintainability**: self-documenting components, meaningful variable names, and scoped styles.
